DevOps Days is a series of worldwide community conferences. 
The series, which began in Ghent, Belgium, in 2009, is run by volunteers whose target audience is front-line engineers and their managers. 
Since the sponsoring group is decentralized, local organizers handle their own sponsorships, registration, and all other management tasks. 
For questions about a specific event, contact local organizers.
